# PublicTransportOnTime
Public transport journey metric stats gathering based on people's experience.

Train/ bus companies publish 'on time' stats based on the train or bus's experience of its entire trip rather than the person making the journey's experience. With access to gps, this app could infer what journey you're taking and whether or not the train/ bus was there to pick you up on time and whether it delivered you to your destination on time. Without gps, you could choose your own origin/ destination/ service and answer two questions to say whether you were picked up on time and delivered correctly/ on time.

An app on your phone generates stats and submits them to a cloud service for calculation, aggregation and presentation.

Things to consider: How to represent cancelled services or getting dropped off at a station that wasn't your intended destination.
